## FOREWORD

This guide was inspired and references BIGJRA’s v13 guide (with permission) and its creation would not have been possible without it. The goal of this guide will be to provide similar content to the previous one with a story walkthrough for both routes, Pokémon and hidden item locations, team descriptions and strategies, and more. Please remember to update your game before you play by hitting the “update” application in your Rejuvenation folder.

This guide will contain story spoilers, though I will attempt to be as vague as possible in my descriptions.


### Additional Notes

**Bolded** Pokémon mean that’s the first time you’ve been able to encounter the Pokémon. This doesn’t include if you caught a Pokémon that can evolve. For example if you can catch a Sentret in one area and you could evolve it into a Furret for you Pokédex, Furret will still be bolded if we can find it in another area. Starters or mystery egg Pokémon will not be bolded, instead they will be bolded when anybody can capture them to account for those looking to fill their Pokédexes.

While I’ll be explaining mechanics as they appear, there’s also a “Mechanics” section at the bottom of the guide so that you won’t have to go looking through the entire guide for when I explained Ruthless Pokémon or contracts and want quick access to the information.

If you are planning a Renegade playthrough, please read the Renegade section at the bottom of the guide (placed there to avoid spoilers). Renegade route demands that you either skip certain quests, or make specific choices that are good to know going in.


## CHAPTER 1: CROSSROADS OF DESTINY


### Prologue

Once you start the game it will show you a list of warnings right before asking if you would like to skip the prologue. If this is your first playthrough I would recommend playing through it, but skipping it does not affect any story decisions later on.

After reading through the Zorua and Pangoro story, take Maria downstairs to talk to Mom. Afterwards enter the bottom room on the left wall and go down the stairs. Go up and interact with the strange table in the center of the room.

Climb back up the stairs and go into the top room along the left wall to talk to Dad, then return to the kitchen to talk to Mom. Go back to your room upstairs. After a short cutscene where you’ll hear the sound of breaking glass go back downstairs to talk to a mysterious figure. Return down to the room with the strange table.

Go down, right, and up towards the entrance and watch the end of the prologue.


### S.S. Oceana

The game will now ask you what difficulty you would like to play on. I recommend Story mode for those that are more interested in the story, characters, and lore and are not interested in spending too much time figuring out hard battles, and Classic Mode for those that would like a bit more challenge and enjoy a puzzling battle or two. Regardless of what choice you make, you will be able to change the difficulty later. This guide will cover battles as they appear in Classic Mode. 

Before registering you’ll have a chance to review and rebind your controls with ‘F1.’ Register yourself as a trainer by picking your gender, sprite, and name.

You’ll be asked if you want to put down any passwords. Passwords are used to change the game by adding or removing difficulty, providing QOL, or introduce other possibly strange interactions. Here are the following available passwords and what they do:

If this is your first playthrough I wouldn’t stress too much about passwords. Focus on the QOL ones if you’d like to make life a little easier for yourself or if you have a need to change the difficulty a little bit. You’ll be able to add or remove passwords later. Don’t enter the same password again if you’re using a password pack.

After you’re done registering, exit the room to talk to your mom. The game will teach you about friendship values and how dialogue will affect how other characters will see you. Depending on your actions and dialogue you might see music notes above a character's head. Blue or gold music notes mean that you’ve gained favor with that character, while red notes mean that you’ve lost favor. Friendship values affect a variety of things, so respond how you would like, just know that it’ll have consequences!

I’ll be writing out each dialogue option with the amount of points that you can gain or lose. If a dialogue branch doesn’t affect the friendship values of a character I won’t be mentioning it.

**Friendship Value Choices**



* I’m fine. (Mom +2)
* … (Mom -1)

After talking to Mom you’re free to explore the S.S. Oceana. I <span style="text-decoration:underline;">highly recommend</span> getting in the habit of talking to everyone and investigating places that seem to be of interest. You’ll gain lots of new information that way, as well as discovering new Pokémon and obtaining items.

For example, going downstairs to the room on the far left, you’ll see a small crack on the wall where you’ll be able to overhear a conversation between a mysterious figure named Crescent and your mom. Heading into the room directly below that and interacting with a similar crack in the wall will allow you to overhear another conversation between a trio of suspicious figures.

Once you’re ready to proceed, head upstairs to the third level and talk to Captain Augustus. He’ll explain a few of Rejuvenation’s mechanics if you want. Head back downstairs and through the double doors to talk to Mom and get the Farewell Banquet started.

Watch the cutscene, then follow the only available path through the ship until you’re off of it.


### Oceana Pier

After you finish talking to Tesla, feel free to explore the pier, but you won’t be able to interact with much until you get your starter. Now’s a good time to look through your settings if you haven’t already. You can access  the photosensitivity/streamer mode here if you need it. 

If you’d like to get the world's quickest game over, head over to the yacht on the right side of the pier and talk to the guide. FREE TRIP! FREE TRIP! FREE TRIP!

Head north through the gate when you’re ready.


### Gearen Laboratory

Enter the building north of you and watch the cutscene. The woman on the left of Nurse Joy will explain a few more things about the mechanics of this game if you need more information, and the counter on the lower left of the first floor serves as a small PokéMart

Gearen Lab Mart

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


You start with $3000. Pick up a few Poké Balls to catch a few team members soon if you’d like. Success in Rejuvenation relies on having a full team most of the time, even in the beginning as you get used to the game's difficulty. I recommend not buying repels since you’ll get an item soon that works very similarly.

Head through the blue door in the top left, narrowly avoid getting run over, and meet this region's Pokémon Professor: Professor Jenner. You’ll be taken to a room where you can pick one of 24 starters organized type and generation they were introduced in. Interact with the rainbow machine on the right side to get a randomly chosen starter.

You can quick save with ‘D’ in front of the starter you’d like and press ‘F12’ to soft reset for natures, shininess, and abilities. In this game all Pokémon can be shiny and have a chance to have their hidden ability. The base shiny rate is a little over 1% and you can check for shininess in the nickname screen.

For those that’d like a strong starter to make the game a bit easier Speed Boost Torchic is the one that is most often recommended, followed by Libero Scorbunny and Protean Froakie. The first gym specializes in poison types, so grass types might have more of a difficult time in there, but all starters are viable in one way or another so pick whatever you’d like! 

Once you’ve picked out your starter, talk to Amanda and get ready for a battle! You can win or lose this one.

	**LEAGUE SCOUT AMANDA [No Field]**

		Hatenna, Lvl. 5 [Healer]



* Tackle
* Play Nice

You can press the ‘S’ key to check the stat changes of all the Pokémon on the field, as well as the field effect, weather, screens, and other nifty information. Amanda will give you _5 Poké Balls_ to get started after the battle.

Go back down to talk to Professor Jenner where you’ll fight Ren. You can win or lose this one too!

	**POKÉMON TRAINER REN [No Field]**

		Froakie, Lvl. 5 [Protean]



* Pound
* Growl

After battling, Jenner will ask you to check in on his daughter Melia on Route 1. For your trouble you get a _Pokédex_ and a _Cybernav!_ The Pokédex is self explanatory, but there’s a few features on the Cybernav that will be important. You can check where you are with the “Map” and change what music you’re listening to with the “Jukebox” apps. “Achievements” allows you to track your progress on all the achievements listed, and help you figure out what you need to do to complete them. “Spice Scent” essentially replaces the need for repels forever, as it changes the encounter rate. Don’t want to run back and forth waiting for an encounter? Set it to 9999 and you’ll be running into a Pokémon on every tile! Or you can set it to 0 and never run into any Pokémon at all! 

The “Move Tutor” app won’t become useful to us until later, but essentially any time you encounter a Move Tutor NPC out in the world and buy access to one of their moves, you’ll have permanent access to it in this app. Basically, if I spend 3 Red Shards to teach Explosion to one Pokémon in a far away city, I won’t have to find that NPC again or spend those red shards ever again, and I can teach that move to whoever else can learn it! Neat, huh?

Head back downstairs. There’s an EV training room on the far right, but none of the rooms are available to us right now. 

There are two NPCs that have side quests available to us in the Lab, evident by the exclamation marks floating above their heads. One is in the downstairs lobby area next to Nurse Joy, and the other is up the stairs in the Gearen Archive room. I will be covering these quests later to streamline everything. For now, just know that all quests can be tracked in the Quest section of the Menu. It’ll provide you with a small summary of each quest, other useful information like quest expiration date, and the location you have to go to next to continue the quest.

Finally, let’s exit the lab and explore what the city has to offer!


### East Gearen City (Left)

This guide won’t be covering every NPC trainer, but from this point forward you’ll start to see Field Effects in battle. For more information on what each Field Effect does, check the Field_Effect_Manual in your Rejuvenation folder. I’ll only be covering the basics for strategizing purposes in specific battles.

The patches of grass around East Gearen have opened so consider catching some Pokémon! \

Wurmple evolving into Dustox is good for the first gym, as well as Chingling and Hoothoot. Alolan Rattata is also a certified beast in early game with the boosts it gets in City Field, as well as its significant speed.

Directly to the right of the Lab entrance there’s a rock with a hidden _Ice Heal._

There’s a _Gourmet Treat_ in the flowery patch of grass below the Lab. These treats are used to encounter some event Pokémon, so make sure to always have a few on hand!

Below that patch of grass there's a rock with a hidden _Poké Ball_ in it. If you go to the right and down and talk to the nerd, he’ll give you a _Reverse Candy. _Below him and to the right there’s a rock with a _Potion_, and to the right there’s another rock with a _Green Shard._  Go north of the Charmer that battles you and in the second patch of grass on the right there’s a hidden _Oran Berry. _

Go back down, to the right, and down toward Oceana Pier. There’s a **Nidoran M** looking for food and you can feed it a Gourmet Treat for a battle.

The garden to the south is now open, and you’ll be able to battle the **Fletchling** there if you interact with them. There’s an _X Accuracy_ next to the flowery patch of grass in this garden, and a_ Sweet Heart_ in the other flower patch of grass in the bottom right corner.

Enter the building on the west side labeled “Ferry Terminal.” Talk to the blonde guy and exit the building to watch the Buizel run by. This starts a quest for later.

Back in East Gearen, let’s start going through all the buildings. To the left of the lab is the Velvet Building. Go up the elevator to the first floor and talk to the woman in the middle. Choose left and she’ll give you a _Mineral Ball,_ choose right and you’ll get a _Steam Ball._ Pick up the _Great Ball_ in the lower left corner and go to the second floor where you’ll be able to battle a **Pachirisu** if you give it a Gourmet Treat and grab a _Potion_. On the third floor there’s an _Exp. Candy XS._ Exit the building.

In the house next door there's a repel that you can sell for some quick cash because of the lovely Spice Scent app.

Exit and go to the right, all the way to where you fought that Charmer and go up past the bridge. Going further up will find you a** Nidoran F **that will run away from you and go to the following locations in order:

	To the right of the Route 1 train station

	In front of the Help Plaza

	To the left of the tree where you battled that Charmer \
	To the right of the Purple Building where you can battle it

Head to the left and enter the Emerald Building and beat the guy in front of the elevator to be able to use it. The second floor will have a _Red Shard_ in the bottom left corner. Talking to the red-haired girl will grant you a _Full Heal_ and talking to the old woman will grant you a _Super_ _Repel_. More free money! Enter the third floor for the chance to battle a level 5 **Shuppet.** Ghost Pokémon that can learn Curse, and any Pokémon that can learn Destiny Bond for that matter, are incredibly valuable to help with some of the harder boss fights in the game, so consider catching it.

Exit and go further left to find a Help Plaza. This building acts as a hub for most of the sidequests in the game. As stated before, you can find sidequests both here and in the overworld - and some side quests won’t be connected to a Help Plaza at all, so be vigilant in your travels. I’ll be covering all of the sidequests found here later.

Next to the Plaza you’ll find the library where you can enter for $300, but there’s really no need to just yet. Instead, take the stairs and talk to the person on the far right of the room. This is Zumi and she’ll give us a quest to find and catch a Dedenne, a task we’ll keep note of for later.

On the bridge next to this building you’ll be blocked by a thug who will force you to cough up $300 dollars or battle him to get passed. He uses 3 12-13 level Pokémon, so only battle him if you’re ready.

Since this is your first real “hurdle,” now’s a good time to talk about what happens after you white out after losing a battle. You’ll be transported to a pastel paradise where your Pokémon will be healed. There’s a PC to swap out your team and on the table there will be some Exp. Candies that differ in size depending on where you’re at in the game. Stepping on the warp pad at the bottom teleports you back to the last Pokémon Center you went to (though sometimes it might not). It’s a nice hub to rethink strategies and take a breather after losing.

Beating the thug in a battle will grant you (+1 Karma), a variable used to track your good deeds around Aevium.

Hidden in the rock in the patch of grass is a _Super Potion._ There’s also a _Red Shard_ to the right of the guard blocking the station entrance in one of the flower patches of grass.

Head all the way back toward the right to enter the next section of East Gearen City. We’re not even close to being done!


### East Gearen City (Right)

Some more patches of grass here, this time with a slightly different set of Pokémon.

Catch a female Jigglypuff to breed later.

There’s a few more shops to look through! First off, talk to the Black Belt in front of the Lilligant sign. He’s selling Pokéballs for $400 a pop which is definitely a rip off. However, if you buy four he’ll accidently give you a** Voltorb!**

Here’s a good spot to sell all those repels you don’t need anymore. You can also sell any vitamins or stat boosting wings since EV training items are easier to come by. Reverse Candies don’t seem incredibly useful until you realize that you can use Rare Candies to over level yourself past the hard cap to evolve or learn a move, then use the Reverse Candy to get yourself back down to the cap so your Pokémon don’t become truant. I recommend buying a couple of Gourmet Treats if you’re already out as well, since they’re always good to have on hand.

Next to the mart there’s a guy next to a truck. He’s going to be how we fast travel around Floria Island, but we can’t do anything with him right now.

Enter the Petal Salon. They sell haircuts on the top floor but you can’t get those until you finish a quest. For now just enjoy the berries sold on the first floor

The rock to the right of the Boutique that’s sitting in a patch of grass holds a hidden _Potion._ Go up and through the fence to get a _Super Repel_ hidden in the rock to the right, as well as the _Super Potion_ laying there to the left. There’s also a hidden _Resist Wing_ in the rock behind the Super Potion.

To the left of the berry filled backyard there’s an alleyway with new Pokémon.

There’s a_ Red Shard_ hidden on the floor 3 tiles from the entrance, a_ Blue Shard_ in the rock along the bottom, and a _Rare Candy_ in the rock at the top.

Exit the alleyway, go down and then all the way to the right until you hit the ocean. You’ll see a **Buizel** staring sadly off into the ocean. Interact with it and win the battle against its old trainer to get it to join your team!

Go up through the hedges, picking up the hidden _Paralyze Heal_ on the left fence next to the entrance. There’s an _Iron_ in the upper left corner and a _Green Shard_ in the flower patch of grass right before the maze entrance. In the maze you’ll find an _Antidote_ in the top right, a hidden _Revive_ in the bottom right, a hidden _Repel_ in the rock in the middle, and a hidden _Red Shard_ next to _TM83 - Infestation!_

Enter the Crisola Hotel.


### Chrisola Hotel

Watch a short cutscene where you almost get run over by a Ms. Blakeory. Oops! (Saki +1)

After regaining control you can talk to the Black Belt in the bottom right corner for a free _Super Potion._ Go to the right hallway and grab _TM126 - Whirlpool_ in the first open room you see. Circle around to the left and enter the top room. Interact with the wall next to the upper left plant to get $1500!

Go back to the lobby and go to the elevator to head to the Casino/AP Center. Talk to the girl with red hair to get her to flush her Coin Case down the toilet so we can pick it up later.

If you’ve been paying attention to the achievement pop ups you’ve noticed that you’ve been earning something called “AP” or Achievement Points. Talk to the Lass next to the counter on the right to receive an Achievement Card that will help you check out how many AP you have anywhere you go. AP points are used to buy things from this counter like HM items that allow you to use HM moves without wasting a moveslot, cards to allow you into the training room back at Gearen Lab, nature changing mints, PP Ups, and Ability Capsules. There’s also an Exp. All, but I recommend holding off on buying it unless you really need it.

The cards allow you into each of their respective training rooms where you’ll find the respective Power item: _Power Anklet, Power Band, Power Belt, Power Bracer, Power Lens,_ and _Power Weight._ I tend to focus on buying the golden items first, starting with the Hammer since we get Rock Smash first.

That’s all we can do here for now so let’s go up to the rooftop where there are new Pokémon to greet us.

There’s an Audino breeder here that will make grinding a breeze. Each time you beat them you’ll get _3 Exp. Candy S. _In the center of the rooftop there’s also a white-haired trainer with a quest marker, but I highly recommend holding off until later to fight them.

There’s a hidden _Oran Berry_ 3 tiles down and 2 to the right of the top left lamp post, a _Reverse Candy_ diagonally from the purple flower on the right in front of the helicopter pad, and a _Resist Wing_ directly across and up one tile from the bottom center lantern.

Go back into the elevator and grab yourself a _Repel_ in the Pool room, hidden in the first rack of towels along the top wall. More free money!

We’re done with the hotel for now, so let’s exit and go straight down in between the train station and the gym. There’s a _Reverse Cand_y waiting for us to pick it up, and in the grass patch to the left there's a hidden _Tiny Mushroom_ in the sixth patch of grass. 2 tiles to the right and 2 tiles up from the biker there’s a _Blue Shard_ on the floor.

Ignore the gym and the house next to it for now and continue to the left where you can enter the Aqua Building. Pick up the _Iron_ on the first floor as well as the _Old Rod!_ There’s a mysterious tenant on the third floor that will battle you, but I don’t recommend it. She’ll seem easy at first until you get jumpscared by a level 80 Pokémon. Let’s just leave her alone for now and exit the building with no sudden movements.

Head back to the right and down to enter Gearen Park where you’ll find a new set of available Pokémon.

The blue flowers to the right of the entrance have a_ Blue Shard_ hidden in them. There’s a hidden _Honey_ to the right of the large rock formation. Go down just a little bit to get a hidden _Carbos_ in one of the flower patches of grass between the teal and dark green tree. Go back up and grab the other _Honey_ in one of the purple flowers.

Keep going up to find a mysterious crack in the ground that spawns an endless amount of **Unowns** at night.

Go back around and towards the right to stand in front of the fountain. 3 tiles down from the rightmost lamp and 3 to the right will find you another _Honey._ Keep going up and grab the _Muscle Wing_ hidden one tile down and to the right of the flower patch of grass in front of the tent.

Enter the tent and prepare for excellence.


### Mr. Luck’s Tent

This tent will serve as the hub for a number of things. For one, the Marshadow in front of the bookcase is a Move Tutor. More Marshadows will appear with better and better moves as you progress throughout the story.

Nothing extraordinary, but a few that can be used in fun strats if you’d like. There’s a PC star on the rightmost wall if you wanna change out your Pokémon to teach them moves.

Talk to Mr. Luck when you’re ready, but be careful and make sure to read through his dialogue carefully. I wouldn’t want you to sign any contracts without your explicit consent, y’know? Unfortunately, signing Mr. Luck’s contract is actually the only way to continue with his quest, so we’re just going to have to hope for the best and sign it anyway!

Surprise, he’s changed you into the legacy design of your chosen character! Talk to him again and follow him to the room on the right to find out about Prism Pokémon and Black Prisms. If you’ve encountered a Pokémon with a rainbow aura then you’ve already figured out that they get a +2 to each stat at the start of the battle. You’ll have to catch the rainbow Pokémon to take the Black Prism off of it. Unfortunately, equipping that prism onto your own Pokémon won’t give us that stat boost, but at least your Pokémon will look pretty!

Prism Pokémon have a 1% spawn rate, so get to grinding if you want to change back to your original sprite.

Return to Mr. Luck once you have your new shiny Black Prism and complete the quest. Try and exit the room before Mr. Luck stops you, and you’ll unlock the Prism shop in his tent. Doxie provides items while Mr. Luck provides contracts that can change a variety of things in your playthrough.

Useful trades if you’re in desperate need of a few items! Cell Imprints change one chosen stat to have 31 IVs, while Glitter Balls have a higher chance of catching shiny Pokémon, or change the caught Pokémon into a shiny.

Here’s where you can change the difficulty of the game, change your chosen protagonist sprite, or sign one of the many contracts that Mr. Luck has for you.

**The Technique Contract**

Makes Pokémon harder to catch for the next 20 encounters, but they can have rarer moves. What this means is that one of the moves in a Pokémons learn set is replaced with one move from its egg move, TM, or tutor move pool completely randomly. For example, if I encounter a Hoothoot it might replace Echoed Voice, a move that it learns at level 13, with Shadow Ball, a move that it can learn through TM. This contract works on wild Pokémon, Legendaries, static encounters like event Pokémon, and basically anything you can battle capture. It does NOT work on gift Pokémon, shadow and raid den Pokémon, and Pokémon that already come with four event moves.

**The Wealth Contract**

You won’t receive any prize money for the next 10 battles, but the next 10 will have double the money. This can kind of be useful if you time it right by fighting rich trainers, but overall is outclassed by items like an Amulet Coin later on.

**The Shiny Contract**

Shiny Pokémon are easier to find, but can run away suddenly like in Safari battles for the next 80 encounters. Trapping moves or abilities like Mean Look and Shadow Tag do not work on stopping these Pokémon from escaping. This contract works on Pokémon you can battle and catch and static event Pokémon. It does NOT work on gift Pokémon or Pokémon hatched from eggs.

You can stack different contracts together, but you can’t stack duplicate contracts.

If you’re eyeing that ???, just remember that Mr. Luck knows all, and you signed a contract (even if you didn’t bother reading it) that said you’re not allowed to cheat. And if you actually do get it legitimately… Well you’ll have to wait for your reward until a future update. Sorry!

Exit Gearen Park when you’re ready so we can finally continue the story! Enter the front yard of the house to the left of the gym to watch a cutscene, then go to the Berry Emporium to receive a _Pecha Berry?_ From the clerk. Give it to the girl on the floor.

**Friendship Value Choices**



* All me. (Venam +2)
* Maybe (Venam +1)
* No, actually. (Neutral)

	

Head to the right and down to watch a cutscene play out between Venam and Ren and enter the sewers. 


### Abandoned Sewers

You’ll be accompanied by Ren in all trainer and wild battlers once you enter and he’ll graciously heal your party after every battle too! If you want to catch a Pokémon with Ren around, you’ll have to knock out the other Pokémon you don’t want to get, but you can always come back here alone later if you don’t want to deal with that.

Some stinky new Pokémon live here!

Qwilfish is an incredibly useful Pokémon, especially later in the game. With its Intimidate ability to weaken enemy Pokémon (especially in double battles) and Destiny Bond that can be boosted with Swift Swim if necessary, it’s a great addition for a lot of the boss battles. If you want Geodude and Noibat I recommend waiting until just right after the first gym, since they’re much more common then.

There’s a hidden _Poison Gem_ south of the youngster along the wall and a _Great Ball_ if you go right after crossing the bridge. Don’t cross the bridge to the left just yet, instead go up and right to grab the _Zinc_ in the corner. There’s a _Bold Mint_ here too. Above the girl there’s a hidden _Potion_ and a second _Potion_ hidden in the barrel to the right. The Bug Catcher also gives you a _Pecha Berry._

Head back down and to the left to cross the bridge, and take another bridge down. If you got the girl to flush her case down, you’ll find yourself one _Coin Case_ richer! There’s also a hidden _Reverse Candy_ in the bottom left corner.

Go back up and left to talk to Venam. The door gets locked from the inside, so go to the left and into the open door after grabbing the _Antidote_. You’re gonna have to activate the 3rd generator, then the 1st, then the 2nd to get the door to open again. Prepare yourself for a battle and head inside to watch a cutscene.

Time for a quick lesson on Ruthless Pokémon! These are the signature Boss Pokémon here in Rejuvenation and modeled after the shield system in Raid Dens, but with a lot more fun mechanics and dynamics. Melia will give you some handy note cards to educate yourself if you haven’t played through the game before but I’ll summarize and explain further details on them here:



* Each RP (Ruthless Pokémon) will have a set number of shields. Each shield is worth one full HP bar and when you break a shield you will trigger one of the shield break effects. After breaking the shields you will also have to knock out the RP on its own, so if you see a RP with 2 shields, you’ll have to lower that HP bar 3 times.
* When a shield breaks the effect takes place immediately, not at the end of the turn. 
* Shield break effects can include one or multiple of the following: type changes, ability changes, field changes, weather changes, item changes, moveset changes. Sometimes they can also raise their stats immediately after it breaks, and it can be any number of stats, not just a stat boosting move. Pay attention to the text after a shield breaks as well as the type symbols in the UI so you’re never caught off guard!
* RP can call for help by summoning other Pokémon. These Pokémon do not have shields but if you defeat the RP first, you’ll still need to defeat the summoned Pokémon. If they’re summoned in the middle of a turn, summoned Pokémon don’t move until the next turn.
* You can PP stall a RP but once a shield breaks it may get a new move that will have its full PP. RP often change out their movesets so this strategy is not always completely viable unless you’re trying to set up for some kind of sweep or toxic stall.
* You can status a RP, but it might cleanse itself between shield breaks depending on the specific boss battle.
* Veteran players might remember that the old boss battles in Rejuvenation prohibited some moves to be used against RPs, but that’s no longer the case apart from a few restrictions. For example, Destiny Bond now works on RP but only once and only takes down one shield, after that it will always fail. Moves like Soak or Worry Seed also work, but some RP can cleanse themselves of those effects, especially after a shield breaks.

For this guide I’ll be using a specific template to try and streamline as much of the information on these boss fights as possible. The first column will have details on what happens when the battle starts and any changes with each shield break. The middle column will include any changes to movesets, type, ability, or item and have it line up with the shield break that it occurs in. The third column (which might not always be there) will include details on the Pokémon that the RP can summon, also lined up with the shield break that they start appearing in.

They’ve kept it pretty simple for your first boss fight, just keep an eye on that type change when all the shields go down, especially if you’re relying on psychic moves. Fast, hard hitting Pokémon will do good things here, especially with Ren and his 3 Pokémon at your side. 

Watch the following cutscene until you gain control over yourself again. Before we do anything else let’s get the most important thing out of the way: gambling!


### Chrisola Casino

There’s a total of 120 coins that you can find around the casino to get your started, but it’s not necessary to grab everything from the shops immediately.

You can get coins by buying them or playing your way around the casino. Voltorb Flip is the most efficient out of these games if you know how to play, and even if you don’t there’s a [website](http://voltorbflip.com/) that can calculate results for you to the best of its ability. There's still a bit of luck involved, but it’s still the most reliable way to grind out coins.

Out of the prizes, Spoink is an easy choice for the first gym and Hidden Power is useful for adding variety to your movesets. We’ll also have to get Flash from here later, so you can grab it early if you’d like.

After you’ve spent the next seven or eight hours gambling your life away, exit the casino to get a few more optional friendship values with Melia in Gearen Park by watching the cutscene.

**Friendship Value Choices**



* You like photography? (Melia +1)
* Maybe (Neutral)

**Friendship Value Choices**



* I love photography! (Melia +2)
* I appreciate the art! (Melia +1)
* It’s not for me. (Neutral)
* Photography’s boring. (Melia -2)

Finishing the cutscene gets you an even higher value. (Melia +3)

You can also go back to the library to fight Ren for some extra experience and cash!

	**POKÉMON TRAINER REN [No Field | 1 Potion]**

		Growlithe, Lvl. 13 [Flash Fire]

* Bite
* Snarl

		Froakie, Lvl. 15 [Protean]

* Poison Sting

		Corvisquire, Lvl. 16 [Unnerve]



* Pluck 
* Power Trip
* Hone Claws
* Fury Attack

A simple Pokémon battle, all things considered. It’s finally time to head to East Gearen’s gym! It’s located right next to Venam’s house.


### The Poison Heart Badge

It’s finally time to take on the first of many gym battles! This gym’s puzzle is pretty easy, and there’s a shop in the lower left corner. You can also catch some Pokémon here!

The tail haired girl to the left explains how the gym puzzle works, and the podium next to it contacts Jan to get some advice for the upcoming gym battle. Step on the white tile in the center stage to teleport behind the shop desk and pick up the _Psychic Gem_ in the trash. 

Enter the door in the top right and make your way across the tiles to the top. Interact with the screen to turn on the power and step on the warp pad to the left to exit. Do the same thing in the room to the left of the stage. You can now use the warp pads in the top room, but first we have to find out the secret about this gym! Battling and interacting with the blue haired girl in the center room and the boy with the orange cap in the left room will give you the numbers to complete this 8 digit code: 2332-4332.

The music notes on the center stage can be heard saying numbers if you listen closely, but if you can’t quite catch it the left one says 4, the middle one 3, and the right one 2. Hit the notes in Right, Middle, Middle, Right, Left, Middle, Middle, Right to change up the right warp in the top room.

There’s another_ Psychic Gem_ 4 tiles to the right of the rock above to warp pad, and a _Fresh Water_ in the bin with the yellow stuff in it. You can also get a **Seviper** Egg at the very end of the alley! Go back and step on the left tile, then the center heart tile when you’re ready to battle.

Make sure to listen to the advice that Jan gives out from that podium whenever you get to a gym battle, as he’ll have some really solid advice as well as information about each gym leader’s ace and their signature move. 

This one isn’t too hard with a bit of light prep work! You can supply your Pokémon with their own Oran Berries to give them that extra bit of health to take them to the end. The Psychic Gems we just got are also useful, especially if you brought a Chingling, Spoink, or Drowzee to the party. Other Pokémon that can do wonders here are Dustox with its resistances and Confusion, and Hoothoot who can also learn Confusion. If worst comes to worst you can always push your Pokémon right up to the level 18 cap to give yourself a serious edge. 

The Convert Venue field isn’t utilized to its full potential in this fight, but keep an eye on how much hype it generates with the background, or Seviper will get really nasty with boosted Snarl and Dragon’s Tail to sweep through your entire team. Be careful of Grimer’s Screech too, since its power is amplified and can leave you extra vulnerable. You have a lot of tools at your disposal here so I believe in you, trainer!

You’ll be rewarded with the_ Poison Heart Badge_ and _TM102 - Poison Sweep. _Before you leave the gym you’ll also get the _Gather Cube_ from Ayuda. Neat!


### Post-Gym Quests

If you’ve been holding off on all the quests you’ve found around the city now’s a great time to do them! We’ll be doing a few minor things before we get into the heavy duty quests first. 

Go to Venam’s House and head upstairs to grab the _Poison Barb_ sitting on her bed.

If you go back to Gearen Park you’ll be able to battle **Gossifleur **if you give it a Gourmet Treat!

Go back to the lab and talk to the lady in orange sitting in front of the computer. You’ll be able to participate in the Virtual League now that you have a badge and will give you a_ Badge Card_ to get you started. Talk to her to challenge the first gym leader: Falkner.

	**GYM LEADER FALKNER [Glitch Field]**

		Hoothoot, Lvl. 11 [Insomnia]



* Confusion
* Peck
* Growl

		Noctowl, Lvl. 12 [Insomnia]



* Confusion
* Peck
* Hypnosis
* Echoed Voice

I always go with Cyndaquil as my starter which gives me an Onix. If you choose Totodile you’ll get a Phanpy, and if you go with Chikorita you’ll get a Mareep. All Pokémon are decently viable, with Chikorita’s pick being the hardest of the three, but you get coverage with Mareep in this first gym. The biggest thing to remember is that the Glitch Field reverts back to Gen 1 mechanics, yikes. Give yourself a refresh of old mechanics - or learn them for the first time - if you need to, as well as the other changes by checking the Field_Effect_Manuel in your Rejuvenation folder.

Once you win you’ll get a _Virtual Badge._ We’ll come back for the next one later!

Go to the Help Plaza to begin all of the quests around the city, accepting them from the bulletin board if you haven’t already. Talk to Ayuda in the top left corner to start the Zygarde quest!

A bit of a tough one, as Pyroar gets field boosted STAB Take Down that can sweep your team if you’re not careful. Try some attack lowering moves on it, or cut its speed down by paralyzing it, both can be done with a Pikachu’s Thunder Wave and Charm (obtainable in HQ 6) if you’re having trouble. Once you win you can get **Litleo** on your team.

Claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $350 and a _Nugget._ (+1 Karma)


#### HQ 6: Battle Request

Let’s go to Chrisola Hotel and take the elevator up to the rooftop to battle that white haired trainer. Her name is Novae and she’s got a strong team!

	**WANDERER NOVAE [City Field | 1 Super Potion]**

		Trumbeak, Lvl. 16 [Skill Link]



* Pluck
* Super Sonic
* Rock Smash
* Fury Attack

		Charjabug, Lvl. 17 [Battery]



* Spark
* Bug Bite
* Bite
* Mud Slap

		Rockruff, Lvl. 17 [Vital Spirit]



* Rock Throw
* Bite
* Leer
* Sand Attack

		Steenee, Lvl. 18 [Oblivious]



* Double Slap
* Razor Leaf
* Play Rough
* Synthesis

		Sandygast, Lvl. 18 [Water Compaction]



* Sand Tomb
* Mega Drain
* Sand Attack
* Astonish

		Passimian, Lvl. 20 [Defiant]



* Rock Smash
* Tackle
* Smack Down

This battle can be quite difficult if you’re not prepared. All normal type attacks are boosted on the city field, so even weak attacks like Passimian’s Tackle hit hard. Speaking of Passimian, it’s easily the strongest member on her team and will only get stronger if you try lowering its stats. Make sure you’ve got your own team of six and if you really need to, you can always return to this battle when you’ve raised the level cap with the next badge.

Win the fight to claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $350 and** Pichu!** (+1 Karma)


#### HQ 7: Wretched Music

You can only accept this quest at nighttime, but after you accept you can complete it at any time of day.

* Air Cutter

		Lombre, Lvl. 18 [



* Teeter Dance
* Rain Dance
* Bubble Beam
* Knock Off

This one shouldn’t be too hard, just watch out for those Teeter Dances. 

**Friendship Value Choices**



* You should stop. (Rorim B -2)
* Yeah, he’s a jerk. (Rorim B +2)
* The other guests….? (Rorim B +1)

Go back upstairs and talk to the bellboy that’s in the hallway to the left, and the girl in the blue dress in the top left room in the right hallway. Return to the basement.

Claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $1100 and, a _Gourmet Treat,_ and _TM119 - Magical Leaf!_ (+1 Karma)

And we’re done with our post-gym checklist, let’s head over to the train station that’s left of the Help Plaza.


### Route 1 and Goldenwood Forest

Tesla’s here to check on you! She’ll buy you a lifetime pass for this train and give you _3 Potions. _You can go say hi to her at the hotel if you’d like, but it doesn’t give you any friendship. Talk to the old man in the top right corner and agree to help him before you get on the train.

New area, new Pokémon!

Talk to the old woman in front of the station and agree to help find her Furfrou.

Pick up the _Super Repel_ just above then head to the left. There’s a **Whismur** that will battle you if you give it a Gourmet Treat and a _Potion_ hidden in the pink and blue flowers below it. You can battle the Pidove flying over the bridge if you can catch up to it.

Pick up _TM60 - Quash _before heading through the gate.

Melia is going to join you throughout all our forest adventures, and she’ll heal your team after every fight. Unfortunately this means that the problem with catching Pokémon in the grass with Ren is the same here. You won’t be able to come back to this area for a bit once you leave, so good luck!

You can battle the Sentrets in the overworld if you’d like.

Talk to the Fisherman and accept his quest, then head up to the right between the trees to find the old lady’s Furfrou! Talk to it to send it back to her then return to the old lady. She’ll give you _5 Potions_ and a _Great Ball_ for your trouble! (+1 Karma)

Go up the stairs and pass the left bridge; you can battle the** Yanma** that are flying around! Now go down the stairs and go around until you reach the pile of Apricorns. You have to interact with it 3 times to get all the ones you need. Keep going south until you find that Old Man’s granddaughter. Talk to her to send her back to the station, we’ll get our reward later.

Go back to the Fisherman from the beginning and prepare for a really easy fight. You won’t be able to catch… Whatever this is. But the following cutscene is fun!

**Friendship Value Choices**



* You okay? (Melia +2)
* That was close… (Neutral)

You’ll get _5 Exp. Candy S_ and _5 Great Balls_ for the trauma. (+1 Karma)

Head all the way north until you see the cave entrance, then take a left on the bridge. At the end of this path there’s a rock (just above a yellow flower) that has a hidden _Potion._ Enter the cave when you’re ready.

An even newer area and even newer Pokémon are here.

Head all the way to the left. There’s a _Tiny Mushroom_ hidden in the dark patch of soil near the patch of grass. Go up the bridge and grab the hidden _Potion_ at the bottom of the tree.

Cross the bridge all the way to the right and prepare for a fight with Challenger Mars. Melia won’t join you for this one.

	**CHALLENGER MARS [Cave Field | 2 Super Potions]**

		Aevium Sewaddle, Lvl. 15 [Unnerve | Light Clay]



* Struggle Bug
* Bug Bite
* Breaking Swipe
* Reflect

		Aevian Swadloon, Lvl. 18 [Intimidate | Dragon Fang]



* Camouflage
* Iron Defense
* Scale Shot
* Bug Bite

		Aevian Leavanny, Lvl. 20 [Swarm | Leftovers]



* Slash
* Struggle Bug
* Agility
* Me First

You’ll get a _Star Shard_ when you win and an **Aevian Sewaddle** with Baton Pass! For the first Aevian form we’ll find in this game, this one is pretty great with Intimidate as a hidden ability and good typing. 

Go back and head north on the bridge to learn more about Prism Pokémon! I already explained them when we met with Mr. Luck, but these specific Prism Pokémon are different to the ones that you find by chance in wild battles. For one, you can’t catch these (therefore you can’t take their Black Prisms away from them), and they’ll appear in the overworld with a rainbow silhouette. All of their stats get +2 so be prepared when you spot them.

**Friendship Value Choices**



* Did you get my good side? (Melia +2)
* Don’t take pictures of me… (Melia -2)

Grab the _Great Ball_ hidden in the grass sprouts to the left, the _Red Shard_ right above the rock below it, and the _Tiny Mushroom_ on the top right rock before following Melia into the ruins.

You can interact with the murals on the wall to get some extra information. Follow Melia out the exit.

Welcome to the Silent Grove! You can follow Melia all the way up to the castle-like structure to talk to her. Watch a really lovely cutscene with some gorgeous art. Melia will challenge you to a battle, but before you do that check out her briefcase to find the passcode 3845 inputted. Keep that number in mind.

	**PRE-LEADER MELIA [Forest Field | 1 Potion]**

		Buneary, Lvl. 15 [Runaway]



* Fake out
* Double Hit
* Fire Punch
* Baby Doll Eyes

		Wooloo, Lvl. 15 [Fluffy]



* Double Kick
* Tackle
* Defense Curl
* Copycat

		Stufful, Lvl. 16 [Fluffy]



* Table
* Leer
* Roar
* Brutal Swing

		Hapi (Togepi), Lvl. 17 [Serene Grace | Oran Berry]



* Ancient power
* Echoed Voice
* Yawn
* Metronome

Melia doesn’t get a boost to basically anything on her team on this field, so this battle is pretty straightforward.

Follow Melia out of the Silent Grove, then out of the Goldenwood Cave. After the cutscene type in 3845 first to get an Ability Capsule, then 6489 to get yourself a free Snag Machine and 15 Poké Balls!

Whenever you have your working Snag Machine, you’ll be able to catch Shadow Pokémon. This Snag Machine doesn’t work catching any other types of caught Pokémon though, so don’t even try! Catch the Grunt’s shadow Meowth and watch the cutscene.

If you talk to the grunt to the left you can catch a shadow Finneon. There’s a PC star to the right if you want to switch out your team for a future boss fight. Keep walking down the path.

**Friendship Value Choices**



* We have to. (Melia +2)
* I’m not so sure myself… (Neutral)
* With that attitude? Nope. (Melia -2)

Talk to the Grunt that’s harassing the lady near her garden to get the chance to catch a shadow **Cacnea. **

Walk up towards the dried lake bed to get pulled into a double battle.

	**MISFORTUNATE DUO ELI AND SHARON [Forest Field | 1 Potion]**

		Murkrow, Lvl. 16 [Insomnia]



* Wing Attack
* Pursuit
* Confuse Ray
* Haze

		Misdreavus, Lvl. 16 [Levitate]



* Shadow Sneak
* Psywave
* Spite
* Growl

		Glameow, Lvl. 15 [Own Tempo]



* Feint Attack
* Scratch
* Hypnosis
* Attract

		Stunky, Lvl. 15 [Aftermath]



* Poison Gas
* Smoke Screen
* Fury Swipes
* Bite

Another pretty straightforward double battle. Don’t let yourself get hit with too many debuff or status moves and you should be fine here, especially since you have Melia in your party!

Walk forward and talk to the mysterious figure for another battle. This time you’re on your own.

	**XEN EXECUTIVE ZETTA [Forest Field | 1 Potion]**

		Snorunt, Lvl. 16



* Nature Power
* Stealth Rock
* Shadow Sneak
* Icy Wind

		Minior, Lvl. 16 [Shields Down]



* Rollout
* Defense Curl
* Confuse Ray
* Self Destruct

		Quilava, Lvl. 15 [Flash Fire]



* Flame Wheel
* Quick Attack
* Aerial Ace
* Smokescreen

		Galarian Meowth, Lvl. 15 [Unnerve]



* Metal Claw
* Pay Day
* Fake Out
* Hone Claws

    Zepto (Type: Null), Lvl. 15 [Battle Armor]

* Pursuit
* Double Hit
* Hidden Power (Fighting)
* Aerial Ace

Good news! You can cut down his team right off the bat by catching **Snorunt.** Be careful of self destructing Minior’s and Type: Null, Zetta’s ace who can cut you down if you’re unprepared. Try paralyzing it or grabbing a Pokémon with Intimidate (Qwilfish, Mightyena, etc.) to lower its attack.

Watch the cutscene and get devoured. Then walk left and up until you go into the forest. You can heal yourself with the faint green healing star right before you step on the bridge. Grab the strange looking Poké Ball to the left of it to update your CyberNav to get a new app called “Rift Dex” and receive the data for Code: Evo. Review the data, then walk forward when you’re ready for a fight.

With field boosted Bite and Shadow Sneak (which also gets STAB), Rift Gyarados’ strength is nothing to sneeze at and can be considered a major hurdle for early game if you’re not prepared. Try paralyzing it if you can - Pikachu can come in clutch here if you've got it. Alolan Raticate can also put in work since it’ll deal massive damage with boosted, super effective, STAB Crunch. It’ll boost its defenses when you break down its shield, so you might want to switch to special moves if you’ve got any as well. Good luck!

If you win you’ll get (+1 Karma), but it’s not necessary to progress if you’re having trouble.

Leave Route 1 with Melia, then talk to the Old Man at the Train Station to get your reward for finding his granddaughter: _4 Exp. CandyS._

Exit the station and run all the way back to Gearen Lab to watch a cutscene in the room where you met Professor Jenner. Get ready for a fight!

	**XEN EXECUTIVE MADELIS [No Field]**

		Houndoom, Lvl. 20 [Unnerve]



* Incinerate
* Nasty Plot
* Snarl
* Smog

You’ll be using Melia’s Togepi and Buneary here. It’s important to note that this seemingly impossible fight isn’t mandatory to win against, though if you do you’ll gain (Melia +1). If you want to try your luck I recommend Yawning with Hapi, switching to Buneary to take the Incinerate and then spamming Ancient Power when you switch Hapi back in. If you’re lucky you’ll get 3 sleep turns and an Omni Boost to be able to tank an Incinerate. Hopefully at this point Houndoom’s health is low enough that when you sacrifice Hapi to revive Buneary, Buneary’s Fake Out defeats it.

Watch all the cutscenes and celebrate, we’re officially done with chapter one!


## CHAPTER 2: REDEMPTION


### Junction Bridge

Accept Karrina’s fast travel to Junction bridge and head inside the lab for a battle.

You get to choose between Ren or Venam in this fight as your partner in this fight, and both are solid allies to have. Musharna does have a considerate amount of bulk, but as long as you don’t let it get too many boosts with Charge Beam you should be fine.

You get _TM94 - Rock Smash_ for your troubles and there’s _6 Cell Batteries_ found back inside the factory, three of which we’ll need for a quest later on, so save them!

Go south and use Rock Smash, then go right and use it again. You can battle** Blitzle** if you give it a Gourmet Treat.

When you go back to East Gearen, there’s going to be Team Xen Grunts running around waiting to battle you. They’re easily avoidable, but you can get extra experience and money – as well as some shadow Pokémon! The next to the Route 1 train station has a shadow **Vanillite. **

Go down from the station and to the right to enter the sewers. You can pick up a _Rare Candy_ next to the cell.

ZCell 005: Abandoned Sewers (West Entrance)

There’s a hidden _Reverse Candy_ on the left wall of the stairs when you enter. Go through the gates to watch a peculiar cutscene.

You can battle a **Munna** if you give it a Gourmet Treat. There’s a hidden _Super Potion_ in the top right corner next to the dumpster, a hidden _Green Shard_ above the rightmost Munna, a _Red Shard_ 3 tiles left and 1 tile up from the leftmost Munna, and a _Super Repel_ 2 tiles down and 1 tile left from that.

Go to the left to get yourself a _Telluric Seed_ at the bottom of the docks, right below the line of dumpsters, and a cell.

ZCell 006: Gearen Alleyway (Sewer Entrance)

Exit the area and go back into the city. Go up and to the right to find some more grunts with shadow Pokémon. The one one right of the Emerald Building has a shadow **Wooper** and shadow Pidove. The one above him has a shadow **Bonsly.**

Go to Chrisola hotel and enter the right hallway and then enter the right room on the top section where the lady and her Mincinno is where she’ll ask you to chase after it. Go to the Lobby to talk to it, then the left hallway and around until it gets taken by a couple of grunts. Follow them to Gearen Park and battle them until they let it go. Follow it back to the room where it was originally where the old lady will let you battle the **Minccino.**

Before you leave, grab the Golden Hammer if you haven’t already.

In the next route there’s going to be a couple of trees you can Headbutt. The Litleo we got from HQ: 5 knows it, so take it with you if you want to take advantage of that. Go to the Route 2 train station and buy yourself a ticket to board.

**Friendship Value Choices**



* You guys alright? (Venam -1)
* Cheer up, guys… (Ren +1)
* … (Neutral)


### Route 2

There’s a _Carbos_ down and to the right of the purple flower near the station.

Catch a Cherubi for later and a Dedenne for Zumi.

There’s a _Green Shard_ in the green bush left of the Aroma Lady, a _Red Shard_ in the pink bush, and a _Repel_ past the pink flower to her right all the way down behind the pink tree.

Go up the stairs and talk to the man in front of the RV. He’ll want you to bring him a Cherrim for a quest. Level up the Cherubi you just caught to Lvl. 25 to evolve it and show it to him to get a _Miracle Seed. _The next Pokémon he’ll want us to bring is a Magcargo, so let’s keep that in mind.

Above the artist there’s a hidden _Friend Ball_ below the dark pink flower tile.

Go back down and through the cave entrance.

ZCell 007: Gemstream Mine (Night)

Exit and watch a cloaked figure walk away from you. There’s a hidden _Relaxed Mint_ on a left purple flower up from the bridge. There’s also a _Rose Incense_ on the second level in the topmost light pink flower on the right.

ZCell 008: Route 2

Talk to the reporter to engage in a battle, then continue going right and enter the mine again. Go all the way down and exit, then go left past the waterfalls. There’s a mystery egg here that can contain Skiddo, Mudbray, or** **Galarian Ponyta with a random move. You can’t reset the Pokémon as that’s decided when you first make your save, but you can soft reset for shininess, IVs, ability, and the egg move.

There’s a hidden _Ability Capsule_ in the rock behind the egg.

Go back up through the cave, then take the entrance to the right of the ladder. Go down, 4 tiles to the right of the dark pink flower there’s a hidden _Blue Shard_. Keep going down and find yourself a hidden _Level Ball_ tucked away to the left of the bottommost stairs.

To the left there’s a hidden _Lemonade_ one tile left and up from the cell. Enter the building above.

ZCell 009: Route 2

This is the Kecleon Bazaar! The items on the right are chosen at random every day from the table below, but to the left you can buy the ever trusty _Magnetic Lure _for $2000_._ If you equip the lure to the first Pokémon in your party you will only get wild encounters that you haven’t caught yet. It’s a fantastic tool to catch rare Pokémon and fill out your Pokédex.

Exit the bazaar when you’re ready and head left. Catch one of the Aipoms walking around for a trade later. There’s a hidden _Exp. Candy S_ on a grassy tile 5 tiles to the right and 2 tiles up from the cell.

ZCell 010: Route 2

There’s a hidden _Ether_ in the wall 6 tiles above the Primadonna. 

Go all the way back to the entrance of the cave, then head north. There’s a healing star there for you if you need to heal your party and two tiles right and one tile up of it there’s a hidden _Gourmet Treat._ Enter the cave when you’re ready.

Go and talk to Ren.

**Friendship Value Choices**



* Is that strange? (Ren +1)
* What about them? (Neutral)

Go down, there’s a hidden_ Potion_ in the tall rock right below where Ren was, and an _Antidote_ below the wooden crate. Keep going down and cross the bridge after a short cutscene. There’s a _Green Shard_ in the left cluster of crates, a _Resist Wing_ in the rock below the mining rock, and a _Blue Shard_ 1 tile left and 3 tiles down from that rock. Continue down the stairs.

The light blue butterflies near the entrance can heal your party once. Grab the _Blue Shard_ and the _Revive_ that’s 5 tiles left of the butterflies. On the left bridge there’s a hidden _Fire Gem_ 2 tiles right and2 tiles up from the computer, and a _Modest Mint_ you can pick up.

Give the **Lunatone** a Gourmet Treat to battle it and activate the panel for a quest later. When you’re ready, go all the way up to watch a cutscene.

Pick up the data for Code: Materna and read through it before going north.

You’ll get to pick between Venam and Ren for this fight. I recommend Venam because her team has a lot more field boosted moves, plus she clears up the Toxic Spikes that get set up later for you.

Here’s where you’re going to start to see those shield break effects really add up. Galvantula is going to do its best to lower your speed and poison you to do massive damage, and its Joltiks will keep coming around to ruin your day. Luckily it doesn’t have any field boosted moves, so you can try to take advantage of that. If you have a steel type you should be set with its resistances, or you can use its quad weakness to ground moves to your advantage.

Watch the following sad cutscenes until you find yourself at the docks on Oceana Pier.

**Friendship Value Choices**



* You think I can do it? (Neutral)
* Where do I go next? (Ren +2)

We have a couple of things we gotta do before we go back to Route 2, so let’s get them out of the way really quick.

Show off Dedenne to Zumi in the second floor of the library, who in return will give us the _Advanced Pokédex._ This will show a lot more details about the Pokémon you catch like their learnsets, possible egg and TM moves, stats and a whole bunch of other information. Our next mission is to catch a Drifloon, but that’s a while off so don’t worry.

Go to Chrisola Hotel and in a room on the right hallway there’s a woman with a **Shinx**. Talk to her and she’ll give it to you!

South of the sewer entrance you can enter Karrina’s hideout. Go down the elevator to talk to her and she’ll ask for your help to fight off a rival gang in Amethyst Cave.

Take the train back to Route 2 and enter Amethyst Cave once more.

Down 2 tiles and 1 tile to the left of the girl next to the rock to grab a hidden _Nugget._ There’s a hidden _Green Shard _to the left, 4 tiles down and in the wall of the lone train track. Grab the _Quiet Mint_ and the hidden _Mineral Ball_ in the right corner of the minecart. 

In the room where you got sucked in through a portal to fight Galvantula there’s hidden _Electric Gem_ in the top left minecart. Return to the entrance of the cave.

Go up the bridge. There’s a _Red Shard_ below the smashable rock at the end of it, and a _Super Potion_ to the right of the smashable rock along the right wall. Above that, there’s a _Mineral Ball _in the center of the top minecart, and a _Green Shard_ 1 tile up and  6 tiles to the left of that.

There’s a hidden _Zinc_ behind the smashable rock below the drill, embedded in the wall, and in that same drill there’s another _Mineral Ball._ Go to the left to find a _Reverse Candy_ to the left of the second drill, then smash the rocks and go through the exit.

We can’t do much here until we get cut, but you can grab the _Blue Shard_ in the purple flower below the large black one, and a _Green Shard_ in the pink flower 2 tiles to the right of the cuttable tree.

Go back through the exit and climb up the stairs. You’ll have to talk to the weird cloaked figure to get through, but after that you can pick up the _Electric Gem_ in the rock right next to him.

Don’t go through the gate yet and keep going left. You’ll have to battle the Biker to complete Karrina’s gang quest, but it’s a pretty easy fight. You’ll get **Houndour **for your efforts! Go through the north gate once you’re ready.

There’s a_ Genius Wing_ directly to the right once you enter the new area and a _Reverse Candy_ 3 tiles left and 2 tiles down from the smashable rock. Go all the way around and exit to the next area.

Grab the _Repel_ in the wooden crate to the right, then go down the stairs and around to the right to grab the_ Rock Gem_ in the tall rock before heading through another gate.

When you’re ready for a battle, go north and get selected to play the fun games! Pick any of the smashable rocks to make a purple pebble, then pick the rightmost tree since it looks a little suspicious.

Get ready for a battle with Nim!

	**APPRENTICE NIM [Psychic Terrain]**

		Inkay, Lvl. 20 [Contrary]



* Psywave
* Feint Attack
* Hypnosis
* Swagger

		Darumaka, Lvl. 20 [Hustle]



* Fire Fang
* Bite
* Headbutt
* Taunt

		Lunatone, Lvl. 21 [Levitate | Passho Berry]



* Rock Slide
* Ancient Power
* Cosmic Power
* Confusion

		Solrock, Lvl. 21 [Levitate | Rindo Berry]



* Rock Tomb
* Fire Spin
* Psywave
* Cosmic Power

puff

This double battle is fairly simple. Lunatone and Solrock can be an issue with their Rock Slides, but if you have a faster, hard hitting Pokémon you should be all set! Don’t be me and constantly forget that Psychic Terrain blocks priority moves though.

**Friendship Value Choices**



* Yes (Nim +2)
* No (Nim - 2)

Watch an endearing cutscene to get yourself a _Room ID Card,_ we’ll figure out where that goes later. Grab the _Super Potion_ 2 tiles right and 2 tiles up from the sign, and the _Reverse Candy_ up the stairs and the left in a wall before exiting the cave.


### Sheridan Village

Watch the cutscene. A new area means new Pokémon!

If you haven’t caught one already, Spearow evolves at Lvl. 20 and can be useful for the next gym since it revolves around fighting types.

Let’s get some errands out of the way before we continue the story.

Enter the Move Tutor’s house to start the quest to look for her, then exit and cross the bridge up and to the left. Go down, there’s a Tiny Mushroom next to the tile with the blue and white flowers. Enter the building and talk to the clerk. She’ll be upset, but eventually gives you a free Super Potion! Exit and go up to grab the cell here.

ZCell 011: Sheridan Village

Next to the cell you can find Truck Guy! He’ll take you back to East Gearen for free. Go back to East Gearen and go to the Lab. Enter Professor Jenner’s room, then go up and to the right and enter the room on the right with the ID Key. There’s an Exp. Share you can grab here, and some fun notes to read below it. After reading, grab the Audition Tape and stick it in the computer to watch a wholesome cutscene. Go back to Sheridan when you’re ready.

Keep going all the way to the right to enter the Inn. There’s a hidden Ability Capsule in the blue and white flower tile just outside, and inside the Aroma Lady will give you a Sweet Heart. Right now you’ll have to pay $450 to heal your Pokémon, but if you can hold off for a bit it’ll become free with story progression. For now,  enter the first room on the left to trigger a sidequest where we’ll have to go save a girl’s boyfriend. Exit the Inn.

Head north and take a left. There’s an Audino Breeder here that will give you 3 Exp. Candy S every time you win. 

The building next door is the Daycare where you can leave your Pokémon if you’d like. For now, take the female Jigglypuff you caught and any Pokémon in the Fairy Egg group (Pikachu, Pachirisu, Cherubi, Skitty, etc.) to get an **Igglybuff** to trade with someone at the Inn. In return you’ll get a** Smoochum** holding a _Twisted Spoon!_

Go north until you enter Sheridan Arena.

You can battle the Swablu flying overhead. Knock on the door and when you get no response, go back to the CHerry Blossom Inn to watch another cutscene. Follow Aelita upstairs to her room.

**Friendship Value Choices**



* I will. (Aelita +3)
* Why me?? (Aelita -1)

The Inn is now free for us to use! Take a snooze to progress the story and head outside, then go all the way back up to Sensei’s house and talk to Aelita.

**Friendship Value Choices**



* I am. (Keta +2)
* But I just got here… (Keta -2)

Go back to Amethyst Cave.


### Amethyst Grotto

Before we do Keta’s quest, let’s go find Daria’s boyfriend. Go down from the place where you met Nim, then go left. There’s going to be a box of herbs next to the river. Interact with it and follow the voices in the next room, then interact with the **Solrock.** You’ll have to catch it to succeed, since defeating it in battle is not enough. Once you catch it, go back to the Cherry Blossom Inn to get yourself a sweet reward of $8000!

Go back to the cave but this time go all the way back to the Route 2 entrance. Take a left until you see a rock with a pink stone on it then interact with it. Go all the way down to the grotto.

Continue north and talk to… Keta? Receive the _Soul Stone_ and accept the fast travel request. Let’s go to the Help Plaza, it’s sidequest time!


### Sheridan Help Quests


#### HQ 8: Hidden Library 2

Right outside the help center there’s a Backpacker waiting for you to talk to him. He’ll tell you to investigate three different places so let’s take the truck to East Gearen.

Go to Chrisola Hotel and talk to Karen.

**Friendship Value Choices**



* The Hidden Library. (Karen +2)
* Looking for a BATHROOM. (Neutral)

I recommend reading and resetting for the bathroom dialogue anyway, since it’s really funny. Go to Dr. Jenkel’s factory next and watch the cutscene, then go to Gearen Park and talk to Karen. Head inside the library.

Let’s go to the right before we follow Karen. Go up and climb on the bookshelves to grab _TM63 - Embargo._ Keep going up and left to grab the cell.

ZCell 012: Hidden Library

Climb back down and keep going right. You’ll want to collect the 9 multicolored books around this room and deliver them to the empty bookshelf at the top right. If you do, **Elgyem** will battle you!

Go back to the center room and then go down to grab _TM19 - Secret Power._ Go back to the center and head up. There’s a hidden _Ether_ 2 tiles below the candles next to the door Karen went through, grab it and enter.

Watch the cutscene. No Mega Ring for you, but at least you’ll get the _Ancient Book._ (Karen +2)

Take the truck back to Sheridan. The Backpacker will want to take the book off you, and if you accept he’ll give you a _Blue Moon Ice Cream,_ a rare healing item, but you’ll lose the ability to translate Garufan texts… There is one solution, and that is to buy another translation book at the Kecleon Bazaar for $75000. The choice is up to you! But if you do decide to give it away you really should try to buy it again before long.

Either way, go claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $950 and a _Water Stone._ (+1 Karma)


#### HQ 9: Stolen Cargo!


#### HQ 10: Trade Me!/Bounty!

Take that Aipom you caught on Route 2 then go up to Sheridan Arena. Talk to the girl with blue hair on the bridge to trade your Aipom for her **Pancham.**

Claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $1920 and a _Rare Candy!_ (+1 Karma)


#### HQ 11: Fetch an Item!


#### HQ 12: Battle Request 2

This quest is only available at night time. Novae is waiting outside of the Cherry Blossom Inn. Talk to her and watch the cutscene.
